# Group 6: Analysis & Prediction Systems - Status Report

**Agent**: Agent 6
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ⏸️ BLOCKED - Waiting for Dependencies

---

## Current Status

### Dependencies Status

| Group | Component | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Group 1 | Foundation & Constants | ⚠️ **Partial** | `constants_4k.py` exists, but `Vector2D` not yet migrated to scale-based system |
| Group 2 | Vector2D Enhancement | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | `coordinates.py` still uses old `coordinate_space`/`resolution` approach, not `scale` tuple |
| Group 3 | Core Models | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | BallState, TableState, GameState not migrated |
| Group 4 | Physics Engine | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | Required dependency for Group 6 |
| Group 5 | Collision Detection | ❌ **NOT STARTED** | Required dependency for Group 6 |

### Conclusion

**Groups 4 & 5 are NOT complete**. Per the migration plan, Group 6 should **WAIT** until these dependencies are finished.

## Current System Analysis

### Files to Migrate (When Ready)

1. `/Users/jchadwick/code/billiards-trainer/backend/core/analysis/shot.py` (885 lines)
   - Uses `Vector2D` extensively for aim points and positions
   - Currently calculates aim points without scale metadata
   - Methods like `_calculate_optimal_aim_point()` need to ensure 4K scale

2. `/Users/jchadwick/code/billiards-trainer/backend/core/analysis/assistance.py` (1062 lines)
   - Provides shot assistance with aiming guides
   - Methods like `suggest_optimal_aim_point()` return Vector2D
   - Power recommendations and safe zones need scale metadata

3. `/Users/jchadwick/code/billiards-trainer/backend/core/analysis/prediction.py` (666 lines)
   - Predicts ball trajectories
   - Returns `final_ball_positions` and `ball_trajectories` as Vector2D instances
   - Simulation results need proper scale metadata

4. `/Users/jchadwick/code/billiards-trainer/backend/core/utils/example_cue_pointing.py` (198 lines)
   - Example code using Vector2D
   - Needs update to demonstrate 4K coordinate usage

## Migration Approach (When Unblocked)

### Phase 1: Update Vector2D Factory Usage
Once Vector2D supports scale-based system:
- Replace `Vector2D(x, y)` with `Vector2D.from_4k(x, y)`
- Ensure all aim points have `scale=[1.0, 1.0]` metadata
- Update position calculations to use 4K canonical coordinates

### Phase 2: Convert Measurements
- Change from meters-based to pixels-based calculations where applicable
- Update distance calculations to use pixel measurements
- Ensure all returned positions are in 4K coordinates

### Phase 3: Add Scale Metadata
- Verify all returned Vector2D instances have proper scale
- Update trajectory predictions to include scale on all points
- Ensure safe zones and recommendations have scale metadata

### Phase 4: Testing
- Verify predictions match old system accuracy
- Test that all Vector2D instances have valid scale metadata
- Validate shot analysis produces correct results in 4K space

## What We're Waiting For

### From Group 2 (Vector2D Enhancement)
```python
# NEED: New Vector2D with mandatory scale
@dataclass
class Vector2D:
    x: float
    y: float
    scale: tuple[float, float]  # MANDATORY

    @classmethod
    def from_4k(cls, x: float, y: float) -> "Vector2D":
        """Create from 4K canonical coordinates."""
        return cls(x=x, y=y, scale=[1.0, 1.0])

    def to_4k_canonical(self) -> "Vector2D":
        """Convert to 4K canonical."""
        x_4k = self.x * self.scale[0]
        y_4k = self.y * self.scale[1]
        return Vector2D(x=x_4k, y=y_4k, scale=[1.0, 1.0])
```

### From Group 3 (Core Models)
- `BallState` with positions in 4K pixels (not meters)
- `TableState` with dimensions in 4K pixels
- `GameState` with 4K coordinate system

### From Group 4 (Physics Engine)
- Physics calculations using 4K coordinates as input
- Trajectory predictions returning 4K coordinates
- Force and velocity calculations compatible with pixel-based system

### From Group 5 (Collision Detection)
- Collision detection using 4K pixel coordinates
- Collision results with proper scale metadata

## Ready to Start When...

✅ Group 2 completes Vector2D migration (mandatory scale)
✅ Group 3 completes BallState/TableState migration (4K pixels)
✅ Group 4 completes Physics Engine migration (4K compatible)
✅ Group 5 completes Collision Detection migration (4K compatible)

## Estimated Timeline

Once dependencies complete:
- **Day 1**: Update shot.py (aim point calculations, difficulty factors)
- **Day 2**: Update assistance.py (recommendations, aiming guides)
- **Day 3**: Update prediction.py (trajectory predictions, outcomes)
- **Testing**: Verify accuracy matches old system

**Total**: 3 days (per plan)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor completion of Groups 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Review their implementation approaches when complete
3. Update migration approach based on actual implementations
4. Begin Group 6 work when all dependencies are ready
