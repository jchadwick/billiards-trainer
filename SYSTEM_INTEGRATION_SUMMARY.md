7. Service restart
8. Verification and rollback if needed

### 2. System Service Configuration
- **SystemD Service**: `/deployment/systemd/billiards-trainer.service`
- **Nginx Configuration**: `/deployment/nginx/billiards-trainer.conf`
- **Log Rotation**: `/deployment/logrotate.conf`

### 3. Backup and Recovery (`deployment/backup.py`)
**Backup Types:**
- Full system backup (code, config, data, logs)
- Data-only backup (configuration and application data)
- Incremental backup support

**Features:**
- Automated backup scheduling
- Backup verification and integrity checks
- Selective restore capabilities
- Backup retention management
