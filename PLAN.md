# Billiards Trainer Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the remaining tasks to complete the Billiards Trainer system. The tasks are prioritized based on the development priorities in the `SPECS.md` files.

## High Priority

### Backend - Vision Module
- **Task V-1: Implement Table Detection:** Implement the `detect_table` function in `backend/vision/detection/table.py` to detect the pool table boundaries and pockets from an image.
- **Task V-2: Implement Ball Detection:** Implement the `detect_balls` function in `backend/vision/detection/balls.py` to detect all balls on the table, including their type (cue, solid, stripe, 8-ball) and position.
- **Task V-3: Implement Cue Detection:** Implement the `detect_cue` function in `backend/vision/detection/cue.py` to detect the cue stick, its angle, and tip position.
- **Task V-4: Implement Object Tracking:** Implement the `Tracker` class in `backend/vision/tracking/tracker.py` to track balls and the cue across frames.

### Backend - API Module
- **Task A-1: Implement Configuration Endpoints:** Implement the GET and PUT endpoints in `backend/api/routes/config.py` to allow clients to retrieve and update the system configuration.
- **Task A-2: Implement WebSocket Data Streaming:** Replace the echo server in `backend/api/main.py` with a real implementation that streams game state, trajectory data, and alerts to connected clients.
- **Task A-3: Implement Calibration Endpoints:** Implement the POST endpoints in `backend/api/routes/calibration.py` to allow clients to initiate and manage the calibration process.

### Backend - Projector Module
- **Task P-1: Implement Interactive Calibration:** Implement the interactive calibration sequence in `backend/projector/calibration/interactive.py` to allow users to calibrate the projector.
- **Task P-2: Implement Rendering Pipeline:** Implement the full rendering pipeline in `backend/projector/rendering/renderer.py` to draw trajectories, collision points, and other visual aids.

## Medium Priority

### Backend - Vision Module
- **Task V-5: Implement Camera Calibration:** Implement the `calibrate_camera` function in `backend/vision/calibration/camera.py` to perform camera calibration and compensate for lens distortion.
- **Task V-6: Implement Color Calibration:** Implement the `calibrate_colors` function in `backend/vision/calibration/color.py` to auto-detect optimal color thresholds for detection.

### Backend - API Module
- **Task A-4: Implement Game State Endpoints:** Implement the GET endpoints in `backend/api/routes/game.py` to allow clients to retrieve the current and historical game state.
- **Task A-5: Implement Video Streaming:** Implement the MJPEG video streaming endpoint in `backend/api/routes/stream.py`.

### Backend - Projector Module
- **Task P-3: Implement Visual Effects:** Implement the visual effects in `backend/projector/rendering/effects.py` such as glow, animations, and transparency.

## Low Priority

### Backend - All Modules
- **Task G-1: Increase Unit Test Coverage:** Write additional unit tests for all modules to meet the coverage targets specified in the `SPECS.md` files.
- **Task G-2: Add Performance Optimizations:** Profile the code and add performance optimizations, such as GPU acceleration, where applicable.
